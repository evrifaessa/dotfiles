# @evrifaessa's dotfiles
My personal dotfiles and install scripts.

## Why?
I don't want to have to repeatedly sync my configuration files between my computers and servers. Also, when I need to set up a new system, my job becomes much easier.

## TODO
* [ ] Automate the installation part (something similar to [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles))

## What's included
I'll upload whatever I can. Right now, these exist in the repository:
* My [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) configuration ([.conkyrc](/dotfiles/.conkyrc))
### Ubuntu/Debian derivatives
* [A script](/scripts/debian/remove-snap.sh) to remove Snap
* [A script](/scripts/debian/install-flatpak.sh) to install Flatpak and set up Flathub

## I want to add my own configuration
